# CatBox-RS
My attempt at a physics engine sandbox based on verlet integration. <br>
This is also a continuation of my Java attempt [CatBox](https://github.com/CoffeeCatRailway/CatBox), I decided to try remaking this in Rust for two reasons.
1. I ran into limitations using Java and got bored using it.
2. I discovered Rust and got fixated...
